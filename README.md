# Artificial Intelligence: Coursework & Implementations

This repository serves as a portfolio of my completed assignments and project implementations for the Artificial Intelligence course. All work is based on the curriculum provided by the [jinqijinqi/Artificial-Intelligence-Course](https://github.com/jinqijinqi/Artificial-Intelligence-Course) repository.

## 🚀 Key Project Highlights

### 🤖 Natural Language Processing
* **Tang Poetry GPT**: Developed a program leveraging large language models to generate authentic Tang-style poetry.
* **Sentiment & History**: Includes visualizations of model training progress (`training_history.png`).

### 🔍 Search Algorithms & Problem Solving
* **Constrained A* Search**: Implemented an A* algorithm tailored for complex, constrained transportation problems (`astar_constrained_transport.py`).

### 📈 Reinforcement Learning & MDPs
* **MDP Implementations**: Solved Markov Decision Processes for both a Dice Game and a Gridworld environment.
